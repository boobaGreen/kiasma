# KIASMA NETWORK
### The Infrastructure Layer for the On-Chain Economy

---

## 1. Executive Summary

In the human brain, the **Optic Chiasm** is the exact point where optic nerves cross to create a single, perfect vision.
In the Blockchain, **Kiasma** is the protocol where the fragmented Oracle Sector converges.

The Oracle Sector is the nervous system of crypto, feeding data to DeFi and RWAs. Yet, for investors and developers, it is broken: fragmented, expensive, and complex.

**Kiasma Network ($KMA)** is the solution. We are building a two-phase evolution:

1.  **Phase 1 (The Financial Engine):** A decentralized **ERC-4626 Vault** that aggregates top-tier oracle assets (Chainlink, Pyth, API3). It abstracts away complexity to generate passive, optimized yield for investors, while accumulating strategic **"Lobbying Power"**.
2.  **Phase 2 (The Programmable Layer):** Leveraging this accumulated influence, Kiasma launches the **Universal Data Router**—an "Oracle Aggregator" that routes data requests to the best provider at the best price, secured by **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**.

Kiasma is not just a fund; it is a **Trojan Horse** that enters the market as liquidity and evolves into infrastructure.

## Part I: The Financial Engine (Years 1-3)

The immediate goal of Kiasma is to resolve the "Investment Trilemma" of the oracle sector: **Accessibility, Yield, and Security**.

### 2. The Problem: Friction & Fragmentation
*   **For Investors:** Owning the "Oracle Narrative" requires managing 10+ tokens, running nodes, and paying prohibitive gas fees for rebalancing.
*   **For Developers:** "Vendor lock-in" forces dApps to choose one oracle, sacrificing redundancy and price efficiency.

### 3. The Solution: The Kiasma Vault
Kiasma is a **Tokenized Vault (ERC-4626)** that automates the entire investment process.

#### 3.1 Dynamic Asset Allocation & "Circuit Breakers"
The Vault maintains a scientifically weighted basket of assets.
*   **Allocation:** 60% Oracle Tokens, 20% ETH, 20% USDC.
*   **The Circuit Breaker:** If an asset's price drops >20% within 24 hours (relative to ETH), the Rebalancing Bot is **automatically paused** for that asset. This prevents the protocol from selling good assets (ETH) to buy "toxic" flow, protecting the NAV.

#### 3.2 The Yield Engine (The Black Hole)
Kiasma does not just hold tokens; it puts them to work.
*   **Modular Adapters:** Specialized smart contracts manage staking for each protocol (Hub & Spoke architecture).
*   **Auto-Compounding:** Rewards are harvested and reinvested daily. Unlike funds that sell rewards, Kiasma **buys more underlying tokens**, creating constant buy pressure and aligning us with the long-term success of the oracle protocols.
*   **L2-First:** Built on **Arbitrum One**, utilizing **Account Abstraction** to reduce gas costs by >90%.

#### 3.3 Risk Management: The "Merkle Exit Queue"
To solve the liquidity risk of staking lock-ups without incurring high gas costs (DoS risk):
1.  **Liquidity Buffer:** ~40% of AUM is kept liquid.
2.  **NFT Exit Ticket:** If liquidity is depleted, withdrawals generate a Transferable NFT.
3.  **Merkle Distribution:** When funds unlock, the contract posts a **Merkle Root**. Users "pull" their funds individually (O(1) complexity), ensuring the system never freezes.

## Part II: The Strategic Evolution (The Future)

**The Vision:** The Financial Phase is designed to bootstrap the resources—capital, governance tokens, and community—needed to build a **Technological Moat**.

### 4. The Programmable Oracle Layer
As Kiasma grows, it accumulates significant holdings of governance tokens (LINK, PYTH, UMA). In Phase 2, we transition from passive participants to active routers.

#### 4.1 The Concept: "The 1inch of Data"
Just as DEX aggregators (like 1inch) route trades to find the best price, the **Kiasma Router** routes data requests.

#### 4.2 Technical Architecture: Trustless ZK-Routing
To solve the "Trust Paradox" (why trust Kiasma?), we employ **Zero-Knowledge Coprocessors** (e.g., Brevis/Axiom):
1.  **Intent:** Client asks for "ETH/USD price".
2.  **Solver Network:** Decentralized solvers race to find the best provider.
3.  **ZK-Verification:** The winning solver submits the data *plus* a ZK-Proof verifying it is the **cheapest and most accurate** option available.
4.  **Result:** The client gets the best price **trustlessly**.

#### 4.3 The Value Proposition
*   **For Clients:** Always pay the lowest market rate for data with 100% uptime redundancy.
*   **For Kiasma:** We charge a small "Routing Fee" on every request.
*   **Lobbying Power:** We use our accumulated governance tokens to vote for "Bulk Discount" tiers for Kiasma, lowering our internal cost basis.

## 5. Tokenomics: $KMA

**$KMA** is an **Adaptive Utility Asset**. It evolves with the protocol.

### 5.1 Phase 1: The Accumulator (Receipt Token)
*   **Backing:** 100% backed by the Vault assets.
*   **Value Accrual:** As the Vault earns yield and auto-compounds, the NAV of $KMA rises. It is a "Black Hole" for oracle value.

### 5.2 Phase 2: The Network Asset (Deflationary)
*   **Utility:** Becomes the native token of the Router.
*   **Buyback & Burn:** A portion of the **Routing Fees** is used to programmatically buy back and burn $KMA. The value decouples from the Vault and correlates with network usage.

### 5.3 Fair Launch Protocol
We believe neutral infrastructure must be born neutral.

| Feature | Detail | Why it matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zero Founder Allocation** | **0%** | Team buys in like everyone else. No free dumps. |
| **No VC Lock-ups** | **0%** | No private rounds. Pure market pricing. |
| **Management Fee** | **0.50%** | Reduced to **0.25%** for "Early Bird" depositors. |
| **Performance Fee** | **15%** | On **Yield Only** (High Water Mark). |

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| Risk Category | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Contract Risk** | **Modular Architecture:** Adapters are isolated. **Tier-1 Audits** (OpenZeppelin/Trail of Bits). |
| **Asset Failure (Falling Knife)** | **Circuit Breakers:** Auto-pause buying if asset drops >20% in 24h. **Diversification:** Max 15% per asset. |
| **Liquidity Crisis** | **Merkle Exit Queue:** Pull-based claims ensure low gas costs. **Liquid Buffer:** 40% always liquid. |
| **Execution Risk (Phase 2)** | **Ecosystem Fund:** We fund ZK developers via grants rather than building everything in-house. |
