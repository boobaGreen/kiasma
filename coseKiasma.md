## PART 1: Brand Selection Verdict

### 🏆 Winner: KIASMA

**Why I discarded "Thalamus":**
Although the concept was perfect, the name is "burned" by a tech giant. *Thalamus GME* is a massive US platform for medical data management. If your project grows, you risk trademark lawsuits or SEO confusion.

**Why KIASMA is the Winner:**
*   **Web3 Availability:** In the crypto space, this name is clean ("Blue Chip" potential). The only famous "Kiasma" is a contemporary art museum in Helsinki, which means no competition in the financial/tech sector.
*   **Meaning:** It represents the **"Optic Chiasm"**—the exact point where optic nerves cross to create perfect vision. It perfectly fits your narrative: *The intersection of Capital and Data.*

## PART 2: Website Copy (Draft)

**Tone:** Institutional, Visionary, Technical.

### [Hero Section]

**Headline:**
# The Oracle Convergence Layer.

**Sub-headline:**
### Invest in the infrastructure that powers the Blockchain.
*Kiasma unifies Oracle liquidity into a single Intelligent Vault today, to build the Universal Data Router of tomorrow.*

**CTA Buttons:**
`[ Launch App ]` `[ Read the Vision ]`

### [Section: The Concept]

**What is Kiasma?**
In the human brain, the *Chiasm* is the exact point where optic nerves cross to create a single, perfect vision.

On the Blockchain, **Kiasma** is the protocol where major data providers (Chainlink, Pyth, API3) converge. We are not just an index; we are the intersection point between capital and information.

### [Section: How It Works (The Dual Engine)]

#### 🔹 Phase 1: The Financial Engine (Current)
*The first algorithmically managed ERC-4626 Vault for the Oracle Sector.*

Instead of managing complex nodes or chasing volatile tokens, simply deposit ETH or USDC into Kiasma.

*   **Optimized Exposure:** A scientifically weighted basket of top-tier infrastructure assets.
*   **Auto-Compounding:** Staking rewards are automatically reinvested, creating constant buy pressure.
*   **Circuit Breakers:** Active protection that disables rebalancing for assets in freefall (>20% drop).

*You get the yield. The protocol accumulates strategic "Lobbying Power."*

#### 🔹 Phase 2: The Programmable Layer (The Future)
*From passive investors to active routers.*

Leveraging the governance power accumulated in Phase 1, Kiasma launches the first **"1inch for Data."**

*   **Trustless ZK-Routing:** dApps request data; Kiasma finds the cheapest and safest provider in that block.
*   **Proof of Best Execution:** Every request is cryptographically verified.
*   **Revenue Share:** Routing fees are used to Buyback & Burn the Kiasma token.

### [Footer Tagline]
**KIASMA NETWORK**
*Where Data Converges. Where Value Compounds.*

## PART 3: Tokenomics Section

### $KMA Tokenomics
**An Adaptive Utility Asset.**

The **$KMA** token is not static. It is designed to evolve alongside the protocol, transforming from a value accumulation tool (Phase 1) into a deflationary network asset (Phase 2).

### 1. The Dual Value Engine
Kiasma's strength lies in its transition mechanism. The token captures value in two distinct ways during the project's lifecycle:

#### 🔄 Phase 1: The "Black Hole" (Accumulation)
In this phase, $KMA acts as an intelligent **Receipt Token** (similar to an on-chain ETF).
*   **Asset-Backed:** Every $KMA is 100% backed by the underlying assets in the Vault (LINK, PYTH, ETH, USDC).
*   **Yield-Bearing:** Staking yields are not sold for profit. They are used to buy more underlying tokens.
*   **Result:** The intrinsic value (NAV) of every single $KMA token increases constantly, regardless of market sentiment.

#### 🔥 Phase 2: The Deflationary Switch (Scarcity)
When the "Programmable Layer" (Router) goes online, $KMA becomes the native network token.
*   **Routing Fees:** A portion of the fees paid by dApps to use the router is used for a programmatic **Buyback & Burn** of $KMA on the open market.
*   **Decoupling:** The token's value no longer depends solely on the vault's assets, but on the usage volume of the data infrastructure.

### 2. The "Fair Launch" Protocol
We believe neutral infrastructure must be born neutral. We have eliminated unfair advantages to ensure total alignment between the team and investors.

| Feature | Detail | Why it matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zero Founder Allocation** | **0%** | The team must buy tokens on the same terms as the public. No free tokens to dump on the market. |
| **No VC Lock-ups** | **0%** | No private investors with discounted prices waiting for unlocks to sell. |
| **Liquidity Buffer** | **40%** | A significant portion of assets is kept liquid to ensure fast exits without "bank runs." |

### 3. Fee Structure (Sustainability)
Fees are designed to maintain the protocol, fund the ZK-Router development, and reward long-term depositors.

*   **Management Fee:** 0.50% p.a. (Reduced to **0.25%** for "Early Bird" depositors).
*   **Performance Fee:** 15% calculated on **Yield Only** (High Water Mark model). You never pay fees on your principal capital.
*   **Routing Fee (Phase 2):** ~0.1% per data request (Projected).

## PART 4: The Launch Tweet Thread

*Here is the 6-tweet thread optimized for X (Twitter).*

**Tweet 1 (The Hook)**
In the human brain, the "Chiasm" is where optic nerves cross to create perfect vision. 🧠👁️

On the Blockchain, data is still fragmented. Until today.

Introducing Kiasma Network ($KMA).
Not another fork. But the definitive convergence layer for the Oracle Economy.

Here is the Blueprint. 🧵👇
(1/6)

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**
The "Oracle Sector" is crypto’s nervous system, but investing in it is painful.

❌ 10+ different protocols (Link, Pyth, Api3).
❌ Prohibitive gas fees to diversify.
❌ Complex staking (nodes, epochs, lock-ups).

The result? The infrastructure grows, but you stay on the sidelines.
(2/6)

**Tweet 3 (Phase 1: The Vault)**
The Solution: The Kiasma Vault. 🏦
The first algorithmic ERC-4626 dedicated to data infrastructure.

• Deposit ETH/USDC ➡️ We execute the split.
• Auto-Compounding ➡️ Yields buy more underlying assets.
• Circuit Breakers 🛡️ ➡️ Automatic stop on toxic assets (>20% drop).

Zero headaches. Maximum infrastructure yield.
(3/6)

**Tweet 4 (Phase 2: The Vision)**
But Kiasma isn't just a "farm." It’s a Trojan Horse. 🐎

By accumulating governance tokens in Phase 1, we are building the Programmable Oracle Layer.

Imagine "1inch for Data":
dApps ask for a price ➡️ Kiasma wins the auction with the cheapest provider + ZK-Proof of validity.

From passive investors to active Routers.
(4/6)

**Tweet 5 (The Token $KMA)**
$KMA is an "Adaptive Utility Asset."

🔄 Today: A "Receipt Token" backed by Vault assets. The NAV rises as the protocol accumulates.
🔥 Tomorrow: A deflationary "Network Token." ZK-Router fees are used for Buyback & Burn of $KMA.

No free team tokens. Zero VC unlocks.
(5/6)

**Tweet 6 (CTA)**
We are building the infrastructure where data converges and value compounds.

"Early Bird Liquidity" opens soon. Spots will be limited.

Don't just watch the future. Own a share of it.
