# Kiasma Genesis Nodes (NFT Collection)

**The "Angel Round" for the Community.**
Instead of selling tokens to VCs, we sell **Utility NFTs** to early believers. This funds the initial development (Audit, Deploy, Legal) while keeping the tokenomics 100% fair.

## 2. Guaranteed Utilities (Hard-Coded)

These benefits are programmed into the smart contracts. They are not "promises"; they are code.

### 💎 1. Lifetime Management Fee Waiver (The "Whale Magnet")
*   **Benefit:** Holders pay **0% Management Fee** on their deposits in the Vault (Standard is 0.50%).
*   **Value:** For an investor with $100k deposited, this saves $500/year. Over 5 years, that's $2,500.

### 💸 2. Protocol Revenue Share (The "Dividend")
*   **Benefit:** The NFT collection receives **20% of all Performance Fees** generated by the protocol, forever.
*   **The "Honest DeFi" Split:** The protocol charges a 15% Performance Fee on yield. This fee is split on-chain:
    *   **20%** -> NFT Holders (You).
    *   **40%** -> Dev Wallet (Founder Incentive).
    *   **40%** -> Treasury (Project Growth).
*   **Mechanism:** Smart Contract automatically routes the funds. No manual intervention.
*   **Why:** This transforms the NFT into a productive asset. If Kiasma succeeds, the NFT pays you a salary.

### 🚀 3. Yield Boost Multiplier (Phase 2)
*   **Benefit:** When the "Router" goes live and we start the **Buyback & Burn**, NFT holders receive a **Boosted Allocation** of any governance rewards.
*   **Multiplier:** 1.2x - 1.5x on staking weight.

### 🏛️ 4. Governance "Council" Status
*   **Benefit:** NFT holders are not just token holders; they are the "Senate".
*   **Power:** They have veto power on critical security upgrades (e.g., changing the Multisig signers) during the early phase.
*   **Access:** Exclusive "Alpha Channel" in Discord with the dev team.

## 3. Soft Benefits (Community & Future)

### 🔑 Beta Access
*   First access to the **ZK-Router** testnet.
*   Priority whitelist for any future partner airdrops (e.g., if a ZK-Coprocessor partner does an airdrop, we push our NFT holders list).

### 🖼️ PFP & Status
*   A high-quality, 3D generative art piece representing a unique "Synapse" (Neural Node).
*   Displays "Founding Member" status on the dApp dashboard.

## 4. Why this is Safe & Ethical

*   **No Token Dilution:** We are not printing $KMA tokens to sell. We are selling a *service* (fee discount).
*   **Aligned Incentives:** NFT holders want the TVL to grow (to maximize their fee savings utility) and the tech to succeed.
*   **Sustainable:** Giving up 0.5% fee on 300 users is a small price to pay for upfront capital to launch properly.

*   **Supply:** 300
